## About Me 👨🏻‍💻

**Hello!**
I was a media planner for 4 years, before pivoting into the role of a data analyst. I wanted to compliment my media planning skills with something new, exciting, and creative, and I found just the perfect role for that: A Data Analyst! Leveraging on my creative strategy background and technical skills to extract insights from campaigns, automate workflows, and build impactful visualizations for client presentations, being a Data Analyst. I've pick up new skills in SQL, Python, and Tableau, learning about Databases, how to manage them, processing data, storing data, and even presenting them with specialised tools. 

I specialize in optimized SQL queries, Python scripts for analytics, and Tableau dashboards to inform strategic decisions. Focused on solving business challenges and uncovering growth opportunities, I’m passionate about delivering data-driven solutions. I love the flexibility and creativeness data gives for me to create my own projects, the struggle (Google, Stackoverflow, and now Chatgpt)

## Data Projects 🖥️

[General Assembly Capstone Project](https://github.com/MatthiasJY/GA_Capstone)

In this project, I created a Revenue forecasting model and a Recommendation System with Collaborative Filtering using Python for my Capstone project in General Assembly. View more details in the link above!

*Work in Progress*

I'm currently creating a Content Based Recommendation System to recommend the next restaurant to visit with my girlfriend based on the places that recived a high rating from us. The idea I have is to make use of Google Maps API to retrieve a list of restaurants in Singapore
