<br/>

Hi! Jing Yi here.

As a former media planner turned data analyst, I bring a unique blend of creative strategy and technical expertise to the table. My journey from media planning to analytics has equipped me with a deep understanding of how data drives decision-making and innovation.

In my current role, I specialize in leveraging tools like SQL, Excel, Python, and Tableau to extract insights, automate workflows, and create compelling visualizations. From writing optimized SQL queries for data exploration to crafting Python scripts for predictive analytics, I aim to transform raw data into actionable insights.

I am passionate about solving business challenges, optimizing processes, and helping teams uncover growth opportunities. Whether it's building dashboards in Tableau to inform strategic decisions or using Python to analyze customer behavior, my goal is to deliver value through data-driven solutions.
