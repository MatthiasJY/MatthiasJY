## About Me üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

**Hello!**
I was a media planner for 4 years and I wanted to complement my media planning skills with **something new, exciting, and creative**. Leveraging on my existing skills to **extract insights from campaigns, automate workflows, and build impactful visualizations**, I found just the perfect role for that: a **Data Analyst!** I've started to become proficient in **optimizing SQL queries, writing Python scripts for analytics, and using Tableau dashboards** to make informed strategic decisions. Ultimately, my role as a Data Analyst is to focused on **solving business challenges** and **uncover growth opportunities through the numbers and figures**, and I aim to achieve that through these new skills.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to hone my technical skills in SQL, Python, Tableau and more, while exploring how Data can bring a new sense of adventure and excitement into my life!

### Techincal Skills üõ†Ô∏è

- **Data Extraction & Cleaning:** SQL, Excel, Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Data Visualisation:** Tableau, Power BI, Python (MatPlotLib, Plotly)
- **Forecasting Models:** Python (Prophet, ARIMA, SARIMA)
- **Machine Learning:** Python (Linear Regression, Collaborative Filtering)

**The Problem Statement:** An E-commerce company is looking to acquire new customers to shop on their online marketplace<br/> 

**Project Summmary:** 
- Personalisation and localisation is the way to go
- Transaction forecasting model with Prophet and a Recommendation System with Collaborative Filtering was created through Python
- The Transcation forecasting model will allow the company to predict the monthly transaction value for the next 6 months, based on each individual Product and State. This will allow the marketing to be more specific and localised
- The Recommendation System will provide both new and exsiting customer a more personalised shopping experience as they will be recommended products for upselling based on other customers who are similar to them

### The Restaurant Recommender

**Project Idea:** To create a Content Based Recommendation System to recommend the next restaurant to visit based on the places that received a high rating<br/> 

**Project Method:** The idea I have is to make use of Google Maps API to retrieve a list of restaurants in Singapore, rank them based on locations, Google Ratings, and hopefully (not sure if it's possible) on cusine. The end result is to create a model that can recommend the next restaurant that has a high review, not too inaccessible, which also serves a cuisine that has received a high rating from us recently.
