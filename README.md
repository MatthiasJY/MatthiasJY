## About Me üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

**Hello!**
I was in the marketing industry for 4 years, and based on my existing skills to **extract insights from campaigns, automate workflows, and build impactful visualizations**, I found the perfect complementary skill for that: **Data Analytics!** I've started to become proficient in **optimizing SQL queries, writing Python scripts for analytics, and using Tableau dashboards** to make informed strategic decisions. Ultimately, I want to focus on **solving business challenges** and **uncover growth opportunities through the numbers and figures**, and I aim to achieve that through these new skills.

**The Problem Statement:** An E-commerce company is looking to acquire new customers to shop on their online marketplace<br/> 

**Project Summmary:** 
- Transaction forecasting model with **Prophet** and a Recommendation System with **Collaborative Filtering** was created through **Python**
- Initial **data exploration** and **insights** gathering done in **Tableau**
- The Transcation forecasting model will allow the company to predict the monthly **transaction value for the next 6 months, based on each individual Product and State**. This will allow the marketing to be more specific and localised
- The Recommendation System will provide both new and exsiting customer a more personalised shopping experience as they will be **recommended products based on other customers who are similar** to them
