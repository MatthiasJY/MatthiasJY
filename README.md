## About Me üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

**Hello!**
I was a media planner for 4 years, before pivoting into the role of a data analyst. I wanted to complement my media planning skills with something new, exciting, and creative. Leveraging on my creative strategy background and technical skills to extract insights from campaigns, automate workflows, and build impactful visualizations for client presentations, I found just the perfect role for that: being a Data Analyst! I've pick up new skills and understanding about the Data world, and have started to become proficient in optimizing SQL queries, writing Python scripts for analytics, and using Tableau dashboards to make informed strategic decisions. Ultimately, my role as a Data Analyst is to focused on solving business challenges and uncover growth opportunities through the numbers and figures.

This is just the beginning of my journey in the Data world, stay tuned for more updates as I continue to hone my technical skills in SQL, Python, Tableau and more, while exploring how Data can bring a new sense of adventure and excitement into my life!

[General Assembly Capstone Project](https://github.com/MatthiasJY/GA_Capstone)

In this project, I created a Revenue forecasting model and a Recommendation System with Collaborative Filtering using Python.<br/>
I worked with a dataset of an E-commerce store found on Kaggle and came up with a problem statement which will then be solved using insights found in the dataset and Python models.

***Work in Progress*** ‚ö†Ô∏è

I'm currently creating a Content Based Recommendation System to recommend the next restaurant to visit with my girlfriend based on the places that received a high rating from us. The idea I have is to make use of Google Maps API to retrieve a list of restaurants in Singapore
