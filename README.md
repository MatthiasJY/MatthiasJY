## About Me üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

**Hello!**
I was a media planner for 4 years and I wanted to complement my media planning skills with **something new, exciting, and creative**. Leveraging on my existing skills to **extract insights from campaigns, automate workflows, and build impactful visualizations**, I found just the perfect skill for that: **Data Analytics!** I've started to become proficient in **optimizing SQL queries, writing Python scripts for analytics, and using Tableau dashboards** to make informed strategic decisions. Ultimately, I want to focus on **solving business challenges** and **uncover growth opportunities through the numbers and figures**, and I aim to achieve that through these new skills.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to hone my technical skills in SQL, Python, Tableau and more, while exploring how Data can bring a new sense of adventure and excitement into my life!

### Techincal Skills üõ†Ô∏è

- **Data Extraction & Cleaning:** SQL, Excel, Python (Pandas)
- **Data Visualisation:** Tableau, Power BI, Python (MatPlotLib, Plotly)

**The Problem Statement:** An E-commerce company is looking to acquire new customers to shop on their online marketplace<br/> 

**Project Summmary:** 
- Transaction forecasting model with **Prophet** and a Recommendation System with **Collaborative Filtering** was created through **Python**
- Initial **data exploration** and **insights** gathering done in **Tableau**
- The Transcation forecasting model will allow the company to predict the monthly **transaction value for the next 6 months, based on each individual Product and State**. This will allow the marketing to be more specific and localised
- The Recommendation System will provide both new and exsiting customer a more personalised shopping experience as they will be **recommended products based on other customers who are similar** to them

## Work in Progress ‚ö†Ô∏è

### The Restaurant Recommender

**Project Idea:** To create a Content Based Recommendation System to recommend the next restaurant to visit based on the places that received a high rating<br/> 

**Project Method:** The idea I have is to make use of Google Maps API to retrieve a list of restaurants in Singapore, rank them based on locations, Google Ratings, and on cusine dynamically (meaning the score for each cuisine will change depending on the rating we provide). The end result is to create a model that can recommend the next restaurant that has a high review, not too inaccessible, which also serves a cuisine that has received a high rating from us recently. 

*p.s. My understanding of Content Based Recommendation is growing as I work on this weekly. Final method might not be what is stated here as I learn what can and cannot be done.*
